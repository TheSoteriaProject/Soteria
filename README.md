## How to use

**Soteria Tool User Guide**

The Soteria tool is a powerful utility designed to analyze projects for security vulnerabilities and provide various options to customize its behavior. Below is a detailed guide on how to use the tool effectively.

### Usage
./Soteria [Flags] [Project Path]

- `./Soteria`: The name of the executable file.
- `[Flags]`: Optional flags to customize the behavior of the tool.
- `[Project Path]`: The path to the project you want to analyze.

### Flags

1. `--warn`: 
   - **Description**: Allows the tool to return true even if it encounters issues flagged by the insecure communication linter.
   - **Default**: `--warn=false`
   - **Usage**: `--warn=true` or `--warn=false`

2. `--help`:
   - **Description**: Displays a simple help page with information about available flags and examples.
   - **Usage**: `--help`

3. `--version`:
   - **Description**: Displays the latest git tag release of the Soteria tool.
   - **Usage**: `--version`

4. `--enableBash`:
   - **Description**: Enables the Bash Static Analyzer.
   - **Default**: `--enableBash=true`
   - **Usage**: `--enableBash=true` or `--enableBash=false`

5. `--enableMakefile`:
   - **Description**: Enables the Makefile static analyzer.
   - **Default**: `--enableMakefile=true`
   - **Usage**: `--enableMakefile=true` or `--enableMakefile=false`

6. `--enableDockerfile`:
   - **Description**: Enables the Dockerfile static analyzer.
   - **Default**: `enableDockerfile=true`
   - **Usage**: `--enableDockerfile=true` or `--enableDockerfile=false`
  
7. `--enableLogPrint`:
   - **Descritpion**: Enable Log Prints for static analzyer.
   - **Usage**: `--enableLogPrint=true` or `--enableLogPrint=false`

8. `--test`:
   - **Description**: Runs unit tests for the function to confirm code changes worked and the tool is still functional.
   - **Usage**: `--test`

### Examples

1. Analyze a project with default settings:
./Soteria /path/to/your/project

2. Analyze a project while ignoring insecure communication issues:
./Soteria --warn=true /path/to/your/project

3. Disable Bash Static Analyzer:
./Soteria --enableBash=false /path/to/your/project

4. Display help page:
./Soteria --help

5. Display the version of the Soteria tool:
./Soteria --version

6. Run unit tests:
./Soteria --test

### Example JSON Output
```json
{
    "FileName": "../Files/sample_data5/wget_examples.sh",
    "LineNumber": 48,
    "Line": "command=('wget' '--no-check-certificate' '-O' 'installer3.pkg' \"${DOWNLOAD_URL}\")",
    "Issue": "wget --no-check-certificate",
    "Severity": "Error"
}
```

### Extra Features
- If a line contains `# Ignore Match` the line will still match, but the Severity will change from Error to Warn. This helps phase out certain forms of Insecure Communication gradually. (Bash Exclusive)

### Notes
- Flags are optional, but a project path is required for the tool to run.
- Flags can be combined as needed.
- Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

### Tool Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the Soteria tool:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   `git clone https://github.com/TheSoteriaProject/Soteria.git`

2. **Step In:**
   `cd Soteria`
   
3. **Build the Tool:**
   `go build`

4. **Run the Tool:**
   `./Soteria [Flags] [Project Path]`
   - `[Flags]`: Optional flags to customize the behavior of the tool (refer to the user guide for available flags).
   - `[Project Path]`: The path to the project you want to analyze.

That's it! You're now ready to use the Soteria tool to analyze your projects for security vulnerabilities.

### Tool Configuration
The tool currently has two main ways to configure it outside of flags. One being the `rules.yaml` and the second being the `.soteriaignore` file. For the first file it is used to configure the security rules that are to be used and is configured per analyzer. This allows more customization based on the setting for which the tool is being used. 

Example `rules.yaml` Config File
```yaml
curl:
  - -k
  - http
  - --insecure

wget:
  - http
  - --no-check-certificate

ssh:
  - http
  - StrictHostKeyChecking=no
```

For the `.soteriaignore` file this is to be used to indicate which directories will be ignored during the creation of the file pool for the tool. Within the file it supports single-line comments to either give info or to comment out a past directory that was to be skipped.
Example `.soteriaignore` Config File
```
DoNotEnterFolder # Super Important to skip.
sample_data3
sample_data4
sample_data7
# sample_data9
```
