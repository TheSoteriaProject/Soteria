# Contribution Guide

### Use Descriptive Names
Choose branch names that clearly describe the purpose or feature you're working on. This makes it easier for collaborators to understand the content of the branch.

### Prefixes  
You can use prefixes to categorize branches.  
#### For example:

    feature/: For new features
    bugfix/: For bug fixes
    hotfix/: For urgent fixes
    refactor/: For code refactoring
    docs/: For documentation changes

### Include Issue or Task Numbers:
If your work is associated with a specific issue or task, consider including its number in the branch name. 
#### For example:

    feature/id/issue-123
    bugfix/id/bug-456

### Keep it Short and Simple
Branch names should be concise but informative. Avoid excessively long names that may become unwieldy.  
#### Here's examples of ideal naming:

    feature/id/user-authentication
    bugfix/id/fix-memory-leak
    refactor/id/update-database-schema
