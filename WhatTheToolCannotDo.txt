# This file contains what the tool cannot do.

* As of now the tool does not handle single rule checks such as http. Must be checked with something such as wget http.
* The tool has a complexity issue for the bash static analyzer that has a build in timeout that skips the file and creates a log message.
* Does not handle command line input cases for bash files.
 
* Makefile Logs are bot in correct JSON format
* Should have had it handle bash in other files by passing in a temp file to the bash analyzer. 
* After enabling the Docker and Makefile it now does not technically support the warn flag. They were configured in the rules.yaml.
* The logs that the dockerfile and the makefile split out are not in JSON conforming format. They are JSON, but are multiple blocks instead of one big one. Creating Read problems that could not be handled.
