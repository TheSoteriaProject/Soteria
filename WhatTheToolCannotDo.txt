# This file contains what the tool cannot do.

* As of now the tool does not handle single rule checks such as http. Must be checked with something such as wget http.
* The tool has a complexity issue for the bash static analyzer that has a build in timeout that skips the file and creates a log message.
* Does not handle command line input cases for bash files.
 
* Makefile Logs are bot in correct JSON format
